# Bazaar-Flipper-Bot-for-Hypixel-Skyblock
This project is a fully automated Hypixel Skyblock Bazaar flipping bot designed to find the best profit margins and handle the entire flipping process for you.

It connects to the Hypixel Bazaar API to fetch real-time prices, identifies the most profitable items to flip, and then automates placing buy orders, waiting for them to fill, and creating sell orders. It also claims coins automatically once trades are completed.

The bot uses queues to manage buy and sell orders efficiently, ensuring that no orders are skipped or executed incorrectly. It includes built-in delays and randomization to make mouse and keyboard movements look human-like, reducing detection risk.

With its Tkinter-based interface, you can monitor logs, see actions being taken in real-time, and easily control the bot. It’s optimized for smooth operation on Mac, using safe clipboard handling for item names.

In short: It flips items for you in Hypixel Skyblock’s Bazaar, safely, efficiently, and profitably — with minimal human intervention.
